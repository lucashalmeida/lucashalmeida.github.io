          <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Why should we work together?</h1>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Five years ago I came to Canada to work as a software developer. I
            was fresh out of school. Being a full time worker while finishing my
            degree, I thought I knew what to expect next. But I could never have
            imagined how much I would end up learning.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            As soon I arrived in Canada, I was invited to join a new initiative
            inside the company that hired me. We started a new company. From
            that moment on, I became very interested in everything related to
            tech startups. I was reading everything about engineering best
            practices, code quality, UX, UI, design, company culture, business
            strategies, and marketing. I was trying to wear as many hats as
            possible. At first, I succeeded as a software developer. But then,
            my ideas for other areas were suppressed one by one. The work became
            tedious, and the company never reached any success. Despite the
            overall company difficulties, I acquired many skills and learned
            what it really means to be a full stack developer. In the beginning,
            we were only two software developers, so I had to learn how to get
            the job done.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            In 2019 I decided to leave, because I felt that my contributions
            were no longer significant. With this change, I decided to work for
            a bigger startup, to experience a different stage of a company's
            journey. That's when I joined Auvik Networks. At Auvik, I work in
            the Presentation Team, which is responsible for our APIs, UI, and
            Integrations. Here, I had the opportunity to really solidify my
            technical knowledge, and see many of the best practices I read about
            being used.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            For my next career move, I want to either start my own startup, or
            join a small one, like Tailwind UI. I believe that the experience I
            acquired in my early career allows me to be a great contributor in
            both technical and non-technical areas. I love to solve technical
            problems, but I also love to bounce ideas about anything that gets
            my attention, such as illustration, audio synthesis, or leadership.

            Latelly, I've been writing React components with
            <a
              class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800"
              href="https://storybook.js.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >Storybook</a
            >, which is an incredible tool. The way it allows developers to
            isolate components, and unit test them is amazing. I believe that
            most companies would benefit from having a reusable component system
            in place. However, it makes me wonder how we could have high level
            document definitions, such as JSON, that can be used to customize
            such components. For instance, we can have a component for a grid,
            but each use of this grid specifies different types of columns, so
            each grid becomes a new component, and it requires several hundred
            lines of code. The high level definitions may reduce this work.
