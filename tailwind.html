          <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Why should we work together?</h1>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Five years ago, I came to Canada to work as a software developer. I
            had just finished my Bachelor of Information Systems and I was very
            excited about this opportunity. Working full-time while finishing my
            degree, I thought I knew what to expect in my new career, but I
            could never have imagined how much I would end up learning.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Shortly after I arrived in Canada, I was invited to join a new
            startup initiative inside the company that I was working for. From
            that moment on, I became very interested in everything related to
            tech startups. I was reading everything I could find about
            engineering best practices, code quality, UX, UI, design, company
            culture, business strategies, and marketing. I tried to wear as many
            hats as possible.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            As a software developer, I learned a lot about web development, REST
            APIs and different Python frameworks. I worked on every part of the
            product, from databases to product onboarding. In the beginning, I
            was one of two software developers, so I had to learn how to get the
            job done. With time, I found myself really focusing on front-end
            work, where I was able to improve how the product looked and
            performed, while making it easier to use. I acquired many skills in
            this position and learned what it really means to be a full stack
            developer.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            In 2019 I decided to look for a new opportunity, because I felt that
            I had overgrown my current position. I wanted to be more involved in
            the creative process and work on business strategy and leadership.
            With this change, I decided to work for a bigger startup, to
            experience a different stage of a company's journey. That's when I
            joined Auvik Networks. At Auvik, I work on the Presentation Team,
            which is responsible for our APIs, UI, and Integrations. Here, I
            have had the opportunity to really solidify my technical knowledge,
            and see many of the best practices I had read about.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            For my next career move, I want to either start my own startup, or
            join a small one, like Tailwind UI. I believe that the experience I
            acquired in my early career allows me to be a great contributor in
            both technical and non-technical areas. I love to solve technical
            problems, but I also love to bounce ideas about illustration, audio
            synthesis, leadership, and any other creative areas.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Latelly, I've been writing React components with
            <a
              class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800"
              href="https://storybook.js.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >Storybook</a
            >, which is an incredible tool. The way it allows developers to
            isolate components, and unit test them is amazing. I believe that
            most companies would benefit from having a reusable component system
            in place. However, it makes me wonder how we could have high level
            document definitions, such as JSON, that can be used to customize
            such components. For instance, we can have a component for a grid,
            but each use of this grid specifies different types of columns, so
            each grid becomes a new component, and it requires several hundred
            lines of code. The high level definitions may reduce this work.
